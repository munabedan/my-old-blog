### Preface

I recently started web development and I thought it would be a good idea to make a blog -technically more like a journal- where i can write about stuff am up to, inspired by [Rusty Russell's Coding Blog](https://rusty.ozlabs.org/) where he writes about what he has been working on.

As a challange I thought I would start one from scratch , thats when I came accross the term static websites and to speak trully I wasnt really into the gist of getting into backend development. 

(Drum Roll)
### Enter jekyll..

With the promise of a static site generation and support for markdown I got into the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and surely a few hours later i had a skeleton of a site up and running.

I did enjoy the process and the results.



### tl:dr;

I made this from scratch , something is propably broken, if found let me know about it.
