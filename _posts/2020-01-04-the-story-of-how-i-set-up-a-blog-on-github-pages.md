### Preface

I recently started web development and I thought it would be a good idea to make a blog -technically more like a journal- where i can write about stuff am up to, inspired by [Rusty Russell's Coding Blog](https://rusty.ozlabs.org/) where he writes about what he has been working on.

As a challenge I thought I would start one from scratch , that's when I came across the term static websites and to speak truly I wasn't really into the gist of getting into back-end development. 

(Drum Roll)
### Enter Jekyll..

With the promise of a static site generation and support for markdown I got into the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and surely a few hours later i had a skeleton of a site up and running.

I did enjoy the process and the results.


### Tl:Dr;

I made this from scratch , something is probably broken, if found let me know about it.
