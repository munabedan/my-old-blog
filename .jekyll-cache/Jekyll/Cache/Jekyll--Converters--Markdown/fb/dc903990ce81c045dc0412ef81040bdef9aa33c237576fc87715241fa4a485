<p>I recently started web development and I thought it would be a good idea to make a blog -technically more like a journal- where i can write about stuff am up to, inspired by <a href="https://rusty.ozlabs.org/">Rusty Russellâ€™s Coding Blog</a> where he writes about what he has been working on.</p>

<p>As a challenge I thought I would start one from scratch , thatâ€™s when I came across the term static websites and to speak truly I wasnâ€™t really into the gist of getting into back-end development.</p>

<p>(Drum Roll)</p>
<h3 id="enter-jekyll">Enter Jekyll..</h3>

<p>With the promise of a static site generation and support for markdown I got into the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">documentation</a> and surely a few hours later i had a skeleton of a site up and running.</p>

<p>I did enjoy the process and the results.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">Tl:Dr;</h3>

<p>I made this from scratch , something is probably broken, if found let me know about it.</p>
